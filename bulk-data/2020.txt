Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker first suggested that there was a link between the levels of crime in a society and the level of inequality in that society. Agent based models are a powerful tool to study emergent behavior among individuals or “agents” in a closed system. The level of access to wealth, goods and services in a population, and its distribution is known to affect the level of happiness of its people. This simulation allows the user to create an environment with customisation levels for access to wealth and assess what types of behaviour emerge.","programme":"Computer Applications","students":[{"email":"oishin.smith25@mail.dcu.ie","name":"Oishin Smith"},{"email":"aaron.edgeworth95@gmail.com","name":"Aaron Edgeworth"}],"supervisor":"renaat.verbruggen@dcu.ie","technology":"Java","title":"Agent Based Model to Simulate the Effects of Inequality on Crime","video":"shorturl.at/jnrTY","year":"2020"}
