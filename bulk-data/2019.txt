The main focus became the development and introduction of autonomy into an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the intention to aid in a cave rescue situation. The objectives were to produce a line-following drone, which could evade obstacles and locate heat signatures in order to identify people who may be lost or injured. The results obtained revealed that basic autonomous drone flight without GPS was not very repeatable and contained a lot of drift. Further development would be required to increase flight accuracy, such as filtering the drone’s directional coordinates which would be retrieved from the accelerometer to verify its location.","programme":"Mechatronic Engineering – ME4","students":[{"email":"angela.prior7@mail.dcu.ie","name":"Angela Prior"}],"supervisor":"Paul Young","technology":"C#, Excel/VB, Nodejs","title":"Investigate and develop an autonomous, human locating UAV to aid in Cave Rescue","year":"2019"}
